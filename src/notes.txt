Key features we get from React:
- Virtual DOM - much faster render times (only change 1 part of the document instead of reloading whole doc)
- Can use components to make re-usability possible in the world of HTML/CSS/JS
- Unopinionated, very few rules we need to follow

Still need to be applying SOLID where sensible!

list.MAP is a really powerful and commonly used function in react
Often, we should map the value and index within map, to assign each output a unique key. E.g.

                    const fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana"]

                    const fruitsList = fruits.map((fruit, index) => (
                        <li key={index}>{fruit}</li>
                    ));

                    return (
                        <ul>{fruitsList}</ul>
                    )
